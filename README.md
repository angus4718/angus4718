Hi, my name is Angus!
==============================

MS Computational Finance @ Carnegie Mellon University
-----------------------------------------------------

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Finance with a minor in Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, graduating with First Class Honors.

I am passionate about quantitative finance and applying mathematical and computational techniques to solve real-world problems. My repositories showcase projects ranging from trading strategies and financial modeling to algorithmic problem-solving and educational tools.
